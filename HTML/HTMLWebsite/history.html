    <p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004.
         At that time, <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,<sup>[9]</sup> and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. 
        In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.<sup>[10]</sup></p>
  <p>The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> Consortium (W3C) workshop in June 2004,
      [11] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,
      [12] including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0.
       The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
      <sup>[13] </sup> Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced. 
      <sup>[14]</sup> The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5.
      <sup>[15]</sup> The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.</p>
